lockrock=Lockrock
lockrock_bio=The starter of all Key elementals. Evolving from having eyes on their mouths, one thing you may not know about this monster is that it has perfect hygiene! You may think how without any arms, but with the help with a bopells floating hand it can have the best teeth cleaning in the entire island!

lockrock_rare=Rare Lockrock
lockrock_rare_bio=What do you get when you combine metal and a lockrock? Rare lockrock, of course! These species have seen too much vhenshuns traveling by (somehow) Key Island, and wanted to be similar!

bopell=Bopell
bopell_bio=Welcome to the monster choir, where all the best monsters are here to sing..... wait... why is bopell here? Do you even know them anyways? Formed when a stone is shaved eyeholes, another stone is shaped to form a hand, and with a bit of magic we get bopell!

bopell_rare=Rare Bopell
bopell_rare_bio=Rare Bopells are often very caring for their babies, but not when playing! Instead of a bell, they knock their nests with their children inside, luckily their children don't mind.

triturtoud=Triturtoud
triturtoud_bio=In this universe, instead of blarrets, we have Triturtouds. Sounding almost the same, you'd wonder if they know each other, and the answer is yes! Through some advanced tech in the monster world, they have been able to communicate, wow!

triturtoud_rare=Rare Triturtoud
triturtoud_rare_bio=Unlike the common triturtoud, which is all soft and friendly, the rare is the complete opposite! Instead of clouds, there are thunderclouds, the result of construction not being finished whilst triturtoud was walking through the island with it's eyes closed, and falling OFF the island! It took 7 hours for the monsters to bring rare triturtoud back.

string_unfinishedIsland=This island is unfinished! Some monsters may not sing or have bad/broken animations!
